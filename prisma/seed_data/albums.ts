In the interim, Lil Wayne released his two other albums in 2010: the largely rock-themed Rebirth, and I Am Not a Human Being. The latter was reportedly composed from unreleased material from the original Tha Carter IV sessions, as the album was released whilst Wayne served a prison sentence at Rikers Island prison for illegal possession of a weapon, and was thus unable to record any new material: this also meant Tha Carter IV's recording sessions were once more put on hold.",

Following the release of her genre-spanning fourth studio album Red (2012), noted for its pop hooks and electronic accents, the media questioned the validity of Swift's status as a country artist. Inspired by 1980s synth-pop to create a record that shifted her sound and image from country to mainstream pop, Swift enlisted Max Martin as co-executive producer, and titled her fifth album after her birth year as a symbolic rebirth of her artistry.",

With a total length of just under 22 minutes, the album is barely an LP, and does not feature a song longer than three minutes, which is considered unconventional for a studio album. The album was supported by the lead single "Revenge", and is XXXTentacion\'s second commercial record, following the compilation mixtape of the same name (2017). 17 includes a sole appearance from Trippie Redd and heavy sampling of  Shiloh Dynasty, and production was handled by XXXTentacion, among others.',
